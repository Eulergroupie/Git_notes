    <h1>Basic Git Workflow</h1>
        <p>Git is the industry standard version control system for web developers.</p>
        <p>A project managed with Git is called a Git repository.</p>
        <p>GitHub is a popular hosting service for Git repositories. As GitHub is in the cloud, you can back-up your files,
        share your code, and collaborate with others.
        </p>
        <p><strong>git init</strong> initializes a new project, essentially creating the working directory.<br>
        <strong>git add <em>filename</em></strong> puts <em>filename</em> into the staging area.<br>
        <strong>git add <em>filename1 filename2</em></strong> puts two files into staging.<br>
        <strong>git status</strong> shows what is in the staging area.<br>
        <strong>git commit -m "<em>comment</em>"</strong> moves everything in the staging area to the local repository.</p>

        <p><strong>git diff <em>filename</em></strong> checks the differences between the working directory and the staging
        area.<br>
        <strong>git log</strong> shows the history of commits. The log is in chronological order with the most recent commit 
        at the top. Each commit entry contains:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>A 40 character hash code (called SHA) that uniquely identifies the commit</li>
            <li>The commit author</li>
            <li>The date and time of the commit</li>
            <li>The commit message</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    <h1>BackTracking</h1>
        <p>Backtracking differs from making a new commit. By backtracking instead of making new commits, we’re able to make
         small changes to our previous commits without cluttering our repository history with commit messages similar to 
         “forgot to add file X from my previous commit so doing that now.” It’s important to understand that when you
         backtrack to amend your last commit, you’re not so much fixing it as replacing it entirely with a new, improved
         commit that pushes the old commit out of the way and puts the new commit in its place. Effectively, it’s as if the
         previous commit never happened, and it won’t show up in your repository history.</p>
        <p>In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit.</p>
        <p>To see the HEAD commit, enter <strong>git show HEAD</strong> The output will display everything the git log
         command displays for the HEAD commit, plus all of the file changes that were commited.</p>
        <p>Say that you've made a change to a file in your working directory, but decide that you want to go back to how
         you had it before the last commit (having forgotten the exact differences). Typing <strong>git checkout HEAD <em>
         filename</em></strong> will change your working copy back. (shortcut: <strong>git checkout -- <em>filename</em>
         </strong>)</p>
        <p>Say that you've added a file to staging, continued to make changes to the file in the working directory, and 
         then realize that you shouldn't have added that file to staging. Typing <strong>git reset HEAD <em>filename</em>
         </strong> will reset the file in staging to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from 
         the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area.</p>
        <p>Say that you've commited several times and realize you would like to restart at a point several commits back. 
         Type <strong>git reset <em>commit_SHA</em></strong> where <em>commit_SHA</em> is the first seven characters of
         the 40 character hash code that corresponds to the last commit that you would like to return to. HEAD is now set
         to that previous commit.</p>
