        <h1>Collaboration</h1>
            <p>Git offers a suite of collaboration tools to make working with others on a project easier. 
            A <em>remote repository</em> is a shared Git repository that allows multiple collaborators to work on the same Git project
             from different locations. Collaborators work on the project independently, and merge changes together when they are
             ready to do so.</p>
            <strong>Features of a remote repository:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A complete replica of the project on your own computers</li>
                <li>A way to keep track of and review each other’s work</li>
                <li>Access to a definitive project version</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Cloning</h2>
            <p>In order to get a replica of a repository type <strong>git clone <em>remote_location clone_name</em></strong>. <br>
            <em>remote_location</em> tells Git where to go to find the remote repository. This could be a web address or a
             filepath.<br>
            <em>clone_name</em> is the name you give to the directory in which Git will clone the repository locally. Your local 
             repository is not visible to other collaborators. The default name of the remote repository is <em>origin</em>. <br>
            Type <strong>git remote -v</strong> to see a list of a Git project's remotes.</p>
        <h2>Fetching and Merging Updates</h2>
            <p>An easy way to see if changes have been made to the remote and bring the changes down to your local copy is with 
             <strong>git fetch</strong>. This command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. It brings
             those changes onto what’s called a remote branch. Even though the new commits have been fetched to your local copy of
             the Git project, those commits are on the origin/master branch. Your local master branch has not been updated yet, so
             you can’t view or make changes to any of the work added. Now we would use the git merge command to integrate
             origin/master into your local master branch. Type <strong>git merge origin/master</strong> to do this. Git will
             perform a “fast-forward” merge, bringing your local master branch up to speed with the most recent commit on the remote.
            </p>
        <h2>Git Workflow</h2>
            <p>The workflow for Git collaborations typically follows this order:
                <ol>
                    <li>Fetch and merge changes from the remote</li>
                    <li>Create a branch to work on a new project feature</li>
                    <li>Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work</li>
                    <li>Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)</li>
                    <li>Push your branch up to the remote for review</li>
                </ol></p>
            <p>Step 5 is where you share your work with the remote repository by typing <strong>git push origin 
             <em>your_branch_name</em></strong>, where <em>your_branch_name</em> is the local branch that you worked on and wish to
             update the remote.</p>
            <p>Git projects are usually managed on Github, a website that hosts Git projects for millions of users. With Github you
             can access your projects from anywhere in the world by using the basic workflow you learned here.</p>
