        <h1>Git Branching and Merging</h1>
        <h2>Branching</h2>
            <p>The default local repository is the Git branch called master. Git allows us to create branches to experiment
             with versions of a project. Imagine you want to create a version of a story with a happy ending. You can create a new
             branch and make the happy ending changes to that branch only. It will have no effect on the master branch until you’re
             ready to merge the happy ending to the master branch.<br>
             Type <strong>git branch</strong> to see which branch you're on. In the output, the * (asterisk) is showing you what
             branch you’re on.</p>
            <p>Type <strong>git branch <em>new_branch</em></strong> to create a new branch.<br>
            Switch to the new branch with <strong>git checkout <em>branch_name</em></strong>.<br>
            Now when you add or commit files, you will be doing it in the new branch.</p>
        <h2>Merging</h2>
            <p>If you decide that the version in the new branch is suitable for being the main project, you can merge the branch
             into the master branch. To do this, switch to the master branch with <strong>git checkout master</strong> and then
             type <strong>git merge <em>branch_name</em></strong>. Now you could switch back to the other branch and continue with
             changes, or you could stay in master and delete the branch with <strong>git branch -d <em>branch_name</em></strong>. 
             If you decided not to merge the branch in the first place, you can simply delete the branch by switching to master
             and typing <strong>git branch -D <em>branch_name</em></strong>. The capital D is necessary if the branch was not
             merged. Note: In this example, the new branch is called the "giver" while the master is the "receiver".</p>
        <h2>Merge Conflicts</h2>
            <p>If changes are made to the master branch while changes have also been made to a new branch, an error called a merge
             conflict may appear when trying to merge the new branch back into the master. Git will not choose which branch changes 
             have higher priority. It marks the file(s) with changes indicating which version exists in the master (HEAD) and which 
             changes occur in the new branch. If the edits are not visible, you may have to close and re-open the file(s). In order to
             overcome the conflict, the file(s) must be changed in the master branch such that one version of the edits is selected 
             and all edit marks created by Git are removed. Then the file(s) should be added and commited. Then delete the other
             branch.</p>
